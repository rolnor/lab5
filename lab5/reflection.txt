-What did you learn? What did you know already?
Got a better understanding of inheritence usage. 
Interesting to work a bit with SDL.

-What was difficult in the lab? How did you overcome it?
Memory handeling with different scopes. Still much trial and error when 
solving bugs from adressing memory. The SDL part was a bit hard to understand because of the scope of the library.

-How can the lab be improved?
Nothing much to add. Good structured lab with interesting parts of SDL.

-Additionally, write an estimate how many hours you spent on this lab.
About 3 work days.
